## Technical Details

This Source Editor Extension makes use of XPC service to run the app sandboxed and use `SwiftPlantUML` (and its dependency `SourceKitten`). Source Editor Extensions using `SourceKitten` (either directly or indirectly) have to either run in a non-sandboxed app (and could not be distributed via the App Store) or use XPC service to outsource the use of `SourceKitten` to a different process.
