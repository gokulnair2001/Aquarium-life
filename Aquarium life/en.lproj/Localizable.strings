"The number one reason" = "The number one reason for fish deaths among beginner aquarists is the absence of nitrifying bacteria inside their aquarium. Fish introduce Ammonia into the water through their waste and leftover food. Ammonia is toxic and it leads to death of fish in new aquariums.\nThe nitrifying bacteria if present, converts Ammonia into Nitrites and further Nitrites into Nitrates. Nitrates are not as toxic as Ammonia and fish can survive in moderate levels of Nitrates.\nThe nitrifying bacteria are formed automatically in the aquarium water and they form colonies on all surfaces in the aquarium and its filter. The key thing to remember is that it takes at least 3-4 weeks for nitrifying bacteria to form in sufficient quantity to support the fish load. This process can be kickstarted by initially running an old filter, which would contain nitrifying bacteria, on a new aquarium for a week. This will speed up the nitrogen cycle and fish can be safely introduced incrementally in the aquarium.";
